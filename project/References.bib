The article explains basic interference mechanisms and quantifies their impact through both actual measurements and simulation. We have developed a detailed simulator that fully models behavior of the physical layer (PHY) and media access control ({MAC}) of both {Bluetooth} and 802.11b; it is used to expand the analysis and project the mutual impact of collocated {Bluetooth} and 802.11b systems across a number of geometries, system parameter settings, and design choices, complementing efforts within the {IEEE} 802.15.2 Task Group, which are also discussed. The article concludes with a discussion of techniques with the potential to greatly improve the performance of collocated {Bluetooth} and {Wi-Fi} systems. A key result of this investigation is that while performance of both systems can degrade when they are collocated, a number of techniques can be employed to virtually eliminate the problems},

    ABSTRACT = {The Long Term Evolution ({LTE}) in unlicensed spectrum is an emerging topic in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is about an operation of the {LTE} system in the unlicensed spectrum via license-assisted carrier aggregation. The 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) bands are currently under consideration, but these bands are also occupied by Wireless Local Area Networks ({WLAN}), specifically those based on the {IEEE} 802.11a/n/ac technologies. Therefore, an appropriate coexistence mechanism must be augmented to guarantee a peaceful coexistence with the incumbent systems. With this regard, our focus lies on the evaluation of all the proposed coexistence mechanisms so far in a single framework and making a fair comparison of them. The coexistence mechanisms covered in this work includes static muting, listen-before-talk (LBT), and other sensing-based schemes that make a use of the existing {WLAN} channel reservation protocol.},

    ABSTRACT = {Spectrum sharing mechanisms need to be carefully designed to enable inter-technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, as these bands are an instance of a spectrum commons where highly heterogeneous technologies and deployments must coexist. Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could coexist only in a primary-secondary dynamic spectrum access mode, a spectrum commons offers competition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as {Wi-Fi} and the recently proposed {LTE} in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for inter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a general framework for transparent comparative analysis of spectrum sharing mechanisms in time and frequency, by studying the effect of key constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and interference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating per-device specifics of different distributed {MAC} sharing mechanisms in a unified network-level perspective. Finally, we present a case study of {IEEE} 802.11n {Wi-Fi} and {LTE} in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our extensive Monte Carlo simulation results show that {LTE}/{Wi-Fi} coexistence in the 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such that time-sharing {MAC} mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the general co-channel case, the coexistence performance of {MAC} sharing mechanisms strongly depends on the interference coupling in the network, predominantly determined by building shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low interference coupling, e.g., residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms outperform sensing-based listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanisms and (ii) high interference coupling, e.g., open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT - utperforms duty cycle mechanisms.},

A major challenge in designing an IoT network is to achieve coexistence between different wireless technologies sharing the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum. Although there is significant literature on coexistence between {IEEE} 802.15.4 and {IEEE} 802.11, the coexistence of {Bluetooth} Low Energy ({BLE}) with other technologies remains understudied. In this work, we examine coexistence between {IEEE} 802.15.4, {BLE} and {IEEE} 802.11, which are widely used in residential and industrial wireless applications. We perform a mathematical analysis of the effect of cross-technology interference on the reliability of the affected wireless network in the physical (PHY) layer. We also set up and perform PHY layer experiments to verify the analytical results. Finally, we extend the study to the Medium Access Control ({MAC}) layer. Our findings show that, even though the {MAC} layer mechanisms of {IEEE} 802.15.4 and {BLE} improve reliability, cooperative solutions are required to achieve coexistence.},

In this paper, we present a coexistence model of {IEEE} 802.15.4 and {IEEE} 802.11 b/g, which exposes the interactive behavior between these two standards and therefore accurately explains their coexistence performance. The model focuses on two aspects, namely power and timing. These two aspects jointly impose different impacts on the performance of {IEEE} 802.15.4 networks, depending on coexistence situations. To classify the coexistence situations, we introduce a concept of coexistence range, by extending the concept of sensing and interference ranges across different wireless standards. We characterize the coexistence behavior in each coexistence range and identify for each range the underlying coexistence mechanism and protocol interactions. Analytical models are proposed for the case of saturated traffic and simulation results are presented to validate the model.},

    ABSTRACT = "More and more devices are becoming wirelessly connected. Many of these devices are operating in crowded unlicensed bands, where different wireless technologies compete for the same spectrum. A typical example is the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4 GHz, which is used by {IEEE} 802.11bgn, {IEEE} 802.15.4, and {IEEE} 802.15.1, among others. Each of these technologies implements appropriate Media Access Control ({MAC}) mechanisms to avoid packet collisions and optimize Quality of Service. Although different technologies use similar {MAC} mechanisms, they are not always compatible. For example, all {CSMA/CA}-based technologies use Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) to detect when the channel is free; however, in each case it is specifically designed to improve detection reliability of the specific technology. Unfortunately, this approach decreases the detection probability of other technologies, increasing the amount of cross-technology collisions. In this article, we introduce the concept of coexistence aware CCA (CACCA), which enables a node operating in one technology to backoff for other coexisting technologies as well. As a proof of concept, we analyze the Packet Error Rate(PER) incurred by an {IEEE} 802.15.4 network in the presence of {IEEE} 802.11bg interference, and assess the PER reduction that is achieved by using CACCA.",

    ABSTRACT = {The advent of smart grid introduces abundant number of smart meters which require bidirectional reliable communication. The deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grid networks will be auspicious if the existing infrastructure of {LTE} networks can be utilized. On the other hand, use of {LTE} infrastructure and spectrum by AMIs will further load the already congested broadband wireless networks. Recently, use of the unlicensed spectrum by the {LTE} technology is seen as a promising approach to offload the existing traffic from the licensed spectrum. In our study, we investigate the coexistence of {LTE} and ZigBee networks at the unlicensed frequency band of 2.4 GHz. We consider a time division duplexing (TDD)-{LTE} system accompanied by ZigBee network with FTP traffic model for system level simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the simultaneous operation of {LTE} and ZigBee on the 2.4 GHz band reduces ZigBee's performance, but still meets the data communication requirements for AMI as prescribed by Department of Energy (DoE).},

    ABSTRACT = {Recently, there has been an increasing interest in operating long-term evolution (LTE) in unlicensed bands (i.e., {LTE-U}). However, since {LTE} and wireless local area networks ({WLAN}s) are designed to operate in different bands, they have no coexistence mechanism, which leads to significant performance degradation. In particular, since {LTE} does not sense channel vacancy prior to transmissions, the {LTE} interference severely affects the {WLAN} operation. To address this problem, we propose a fair listen-before-talk (F-LBT) algorithm for coexistence of {LTE-U} and {WLAN} in unlicensed bands. F-LBT jointly considers the total system throughput and the fairness between {LTE-U} and {WLAN} and then allocates an appropriate idle period for {WLAN}. Evaluation results demonstrate that F-LBT can improve the total system throughput while providing the fairness between {LTE-U} and {WLAN}.},

    ABSTRACT = {{LAA} is a new operation mode of {LTE} in the unlicensed spectrum, which will be featured in {LTE} Release 13. Under {LAA}, licensed carriers will be aggregated with unlicensed carriers in order to opportunistically enhance downlink user throughput while still offering seamless mobility support. In order to coexist with WiFi, some of the new functionalities required of {LAA} {LTE} include a mechanism for channel sensing based on listen-before-talk, discontinuous transmission on a carrier with limited maximum transmission duration, and multicarrier transmission across multiple unlicensed channels. This article presents a detailed overview of the design agreements for {LAA}, the impact of unlicensed spectrum operation on the {LTE} physical layer architecture, and the scope of additional enhancements beyond {LTE} Release 13. A range of simulations for indoor and multicarrier scenarios show that fair coexistence between {LAA} and WiFi can be achieved, and that deployment of {LAA} can provide a boost in WiFi performance.},

    ABSTRACT = {Acquiring more spectral resources is a key enabler for the envisioned high data rates of next generation mobile networks. Licensed-assisted access ({LAA}) to the vast and free-of-charge unlicensed spectrum has been therefore receiving tremendous interest, especially with the advancements in small cells and carrier aggregation. We propose a novel {5G} {MAC} solution for fair and efficient coexistence with {WLAN} and other {5G} operator networks in unlicensed spectrum ({5G}-U). A UE-centric joint association and channel selection algorithm maximizes the achievable long-term rates. Neighboring LPNs of the same {5G}-U network opportunistically form per-channel disjoint radio access clusters (RACs). During an active sensing phase, RACs discover their potential interferers and `contend-to-coordinate' their self-allocation of the unlicensed channel. A self-allocated RAC dynamically optimizes its coexistence frames with {WLAN} to achieve the estimated soft airtime share over the coordination frame. We generalize the simple sequential inhibition model, which has been shown to accurately model the carrier sense multiple access, to capture the impact of longer {LAA} bursts as well as the priority access mode in the downlink simulations. Results with single-LPN RACs show substantial coexistence throughput gains compared to two different models of {LTE}-{LAA}. Additional gains are realized with multi-LPN RACs in dense deployment and high channel occupancy scenarios.},
